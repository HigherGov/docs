# FAQ

## What do the Export Limits Mean?

Export limits apply only on a per-search basis. HigherGov has no monthly or team limits on the total number of records you can export.  So if your plan has an export limit of 10,000 records, you can export up to 10,000 records per search as many times as you would like.

Please see our [pricing plans](https://www.highergov.com/pricing/) for our current download limits. &#x20;

## What are Your Data Sources?

HigherGov is the most comprehensive source of government data.  We collect data from 100s of federal data sources including SAM.GOV, DIBBS, PIIE, NECO, USASpending, GRANTS.GOV, FPDS, DSRS, FSRS, SBIR.GOV, GSA Advantage, and many more.  Some data that is otherwise not publicly available is also gathered exclusively by HigherGov via FOIA requests. Our analysts also build our own proprietary data sets (such as our Vehicle and M\&A data) to help connect government data and provide other key industry insights. &#x20;

In the State and Local market, we actively monitor more than 10,000 of the largest agencies in all 50 states and Washington D.C. &#x20;

In some cases, we also allow users to integrate their proprietary data into our system for their individual use using our [Task Order integration](../import-and-export/task-order-integration.md) feature.&#x20;

If you have a question about where some of our data comes from, do not hesitate to ask.

## What if I Have a Custom Research Request?

While the vast majority of research use cases can be completed in our platform, if you have a unique or niche need, our analysts would be happy to discuss.  Please [contact us](mailto:contact@highergov.com) if you have any questions.

## Do You Accept Other Payment Methods Besides Credit Cards?

We also accept payment through ACH or wire transfers on a case-by-case basis.  Please [contact us](mailto:contact@highergov.com), if you require assistance.
