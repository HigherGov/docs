# Adding Users to Your Account

### Adding Users

Most HigherGov [plans](https://www.highergov.com/pricing/) (except for the Starter plan) allow for multiple users on a single account.  To add additional users to your account, select the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of the page or click [here](https://www.highergov.com/account/).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Only account administrators are able to add users.  If you need to add an administrator please contact us in the chat or send us an [email](mailto:contact@highergov.com).
{% endhint %}

Go to the Manage Users section and select the add user button on the right.  Input the Name of the user and their email address and click the Add User button.  That person will receive a Welcome Email with instructions to set up their account. &#x20;

### Resending the Welcome Email

If the user has not yet set up an account, there will be an option to Resend them the Welcome Email on the screen.  The email is sent immediately, if the user still does not receive the Welcome Email, they should check their Spam folder.  Please contact us in the chat or [email](mailto:contact@highergov.com) us if you continue to have issues.
