# Saved Searches

## Saving a Search

On all Category Search pages on HigherGov once you have run a search, you can save that search by pressing the Save button, entering a Search Name, setting the Email Notification Updates frequency (optional), and pressing Save. &#x20;

## Receiving Saved Search Notifications

When saving a Search, you can opt-in to receive an email notification when there are new results.  To receive notifications, select a frequency under Email Notification Updates (Daily, Weekly, or Monthly) when saving a search. &#x20;

Saved Search Notifications are available for all search categories that receive frequent updates.  Stop future notifications by pressing the Unsubscribe link in the notification email or on the Saved Search page (see below).&#x20;

### Automatic Notifications

Many detail pages on HigherGov, including Awardee, Government People, and Agency pages have a Notify option in the top right to automatically create Saved Searches with weekly alerts when there are new results. &#x20;
