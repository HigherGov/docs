# Find State and Local Contract Opportunities

## Contract Opportunity Search

### Creating Filters

To search for state, local, and education contract opportunities, go to _Business Development --> Opportunities --> Contracts_ in the SLED sidebar or click [here](https://www.highergov.com/sl/contract-opportunity/) (must be signed in).  On this page you can add filters to narrow opportunities to those that are most relevant to your business. &#x20;

Common search filters include:

* **Active Opportunities**: Limit the search to contract opportunities with a deadline in the future&#x20;
* **Agency**: Search for contract opportunities within a specific agency
* **Agency Type**: Limit the search to opportunities released by a certain category of agency such as Fire or Police Departments or Public Utilities
* **Keyword:** Search the opportunity titles and descriptions for specific keywords
* **NAICS**: Limit results to contracts that are classified under a particular North American Industry Classification System code
* **PSC**: Limit results to contracts that are classified under a particular Product Services Code
* **State**: Limit results to where the issuing agency is within a specific state or region

You can access your saved searches at any time by selecting the dropdown arrow next to the Save button or by going to to _Tools --> Saved Searches_ in the sidebar.

### Daily Recommendations

You can also opt-in to receive a daily email of recommended contract opportunities by singing in and selecting the gear icon in the upper right, going to Profile, and switching on **Daily SLED Opportunities Email**.

## Finding Additional Information and Applying

By selecting a contract opportunity, you can see the opportunity description as well as key details including the posting and due date and other relevant information.  Most contract opportunities will have a direct link to the source where you can learn additional information about the contract opportunity and details on how to apply.  In some cases, the opportunity source may not have a linkable page, and it may be necessary to search for the contract opportunity ID or title at the source to see additional details.
