# DLA Opportunities

DIBBS is the Defense Logistics Agency's system for acquiring "standardized material items of supply" (standardized products) for the Department of Defense.  On average more than 10,000 solicitations are posted to DIBBS weekly, the vast majority of which are not posted elsewhere.  Most solicitations posted on DIBBS will have associated [NATO Stock Numbers](https://www.highergov.com/nsn/) (NSN). &#x20;

HigherGov integrates opportunities found on DLA's DIBBS platform and provides tools to research related NSNs and other key competitive information.

{% hint style="info" %}
Submitting bids to DIBBS requires a separate registration from SAM.  Because this registration can take over a week, we recommend setting up an account on DIBBS in advance [https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/Register/Default.aspx](https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/Register/Default.aspx)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Searching for DIBBS Opportunities

Current and historical opportunities posted to DIBBS can be found on the [Contract Opportunity](https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/) search page in the sidebar under Business Development --> Opportunities --> Contracts on the third tab on the page. &#x20;

To find relevant opportunities, select the Add Filters button.  The most common filters used for DIBBS Opportunities include **PSC** (also known FSC), **NSN**, and **Set Aside**.  If you want to limit opportunities to those that are currently active, you can select the **Active Opportunity** filter. &#x20;

## Analyzing DIBBS Opportunities

Once you have found opportunities of interest, you can select the opportunity to open up on the DIBBS Opportunity page which will have key information about the solicitation including the set aside, order type, the availability of technical documents, the official solicitation document, and more.

The page will also show the purchase request details, suppliers included in the official solicitation document, and historical pricing details (with linked contracts).  The historical pricing, in particular, can be valuable to get a sense of what price would be necessary to win based on historical prevailing bids considering the set aside, quantity, and the number of bidders. &#x20;

If you want to bid on the opportunity, you can select the Quote option next to Source to go directly to the bidding page in DIBBS. &#x20;

## Analyzing NATO Stock Numbers

You can learn more information about a given NSN by selecting the NSN listed in the purchase request.  This page will include additional details about the NSN including data from DLA's Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) and other information gathered and tracked by HigherGov.&#x20;
