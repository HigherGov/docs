# Review Pipeline and Performance

## Pipeline Analysis

To start an analysis of your pipeline(s), select Business _Development --> Pipelines_ in the sidebar or click [here](https://www.highergov.com/pipeline/).  Along the top of the page, you can filter the analysis by Pipeline and Pursuit owner, which allows you to better understand the performance of teams or individual team members. &#x20;

### Funnel

Shows the weighted and unweighted value of your pipeline by stage.  You can filter the funnel to show different calendar years and can change the measurement to show the pipeline by dollar or by number of opportunities. &#x20;

Note that if you have more than one Pipeline selected the funnel will show the pipeline stages relative to Award (-1 meaning one stage from Award, -2 meaning two stages from Award) rather than by name.&#x20;

### Projections

Shows the weighted and unweighted value of the pipeline by Year, Quarter, or Month.
