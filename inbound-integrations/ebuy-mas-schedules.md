# eBuy (MAS Schedules)

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is currently in an invite-only Beta.  If you are interested in participating, please [contact us](mailto:contact@highergov.com).
{% endhint %}

To connect eBuy to your HigherGov account, you will need to add HigherGov as a Point of Contact (POC) to your eBuy SINS. &#x20;

To do so, please complete the following steps:

1. On the Integrations page on your HigherGov account get the custom email to add as a POC to your eBuy account.

2. Sign-in to your eBuy account and select "Profile" in the upper right corner of the page. &#x20;
3. Select "Add a new POC to a Category" and complete the form using the "HigherGov eBuy Email" found above. &#x20;

Make sure to add the HigherGov eBuy Email to all of your SINS.  Make sure to fill out the form completely.  You can put the contact names HigherGov and our main phone number (202) 640-1748 as the phone number.

Once you've successfully added HigherGov as a POC, we'll sync eBuy opportunities nightly.  Please allow 5-10 days for opportunities to start appearing for the first time during the Beta period.  The opportunities will be available in the Federal [Contract Opportunities](https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/) search. &#x20;

If you have any questions, please [contact us](mailto:contact@highergov.com).
