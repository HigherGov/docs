To connect your OASIS Vehicle Task Orders to your HigherGov account, please complete the following steps:

2. On the Integrations page on your HigherGov account, enter the UEI and CAGE code associated with your Symphony Admin Account and press the Start Integration button.  HigherGov will then request to join your organization on Symphony.

Once you've successfully approved HigherGov as an Active member, we'll sync OASIS opportunities nightly.  Please allow 5-10 days for opportunities to start appearing for the first time during the Beta period.  The opportunities will be available in the Federal [Contract Opportunities](https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/) search. &#x20;
