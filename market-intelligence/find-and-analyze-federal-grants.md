## Finding Grants

### Finding a Specific Grant

If you already know the ID of the grant you are looking for, you can enter it into the search bar at the top of the page.&#x20;

### Searching for Grants

You can search for Grants and Subgrants on the Grant search page by going to _Marketing Intelligence --> Awards --> Grants_ in the sidebar or by clicking [here](https://www.highergov.com/grant/).  Here you can search by keyword or more than 18 different filters to find grants including **Agency**, **Grant Program**, **Start Date**, **End Date**, **Place of Performance**, and more. &#x20;

If you want to learn more about a grant you can click on the grant detail page.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that subgrant data is reported by Prime grant-awardees and the consistency and quality of data is low.  To enhance the quality and reliability of this data, HigherGov removes or adjusts a significant percentage of reported subgrants that are likely duplicates or otherwise inaccurate.

## Grant Analysis

The sections available on the detail page will depend on the type of award and the details of the grant.  The most common sections are below.

* **Overview**: Provides general information about the award including the Awardee, Description, Grant Program (CFDA), Awarding Agency, Place of Performance, and Assistance Type. &#x20;
* **Funding Status **_**(Prime Only)**_: Provides the total value of the grant and start and end dates. &#x20;

* **Timeline **_**(Prime Only)**_: Graphically shows the history of obligations funded under the grant as well as the start and end dates.

* **History**: Shows high-level details of any grant modifications (will only appear if the award has had at least one modification)
* **Additional Details **_**(Prime Only)**_: Provides additional information about the grant including the government's agency categorizations.

## Finding Additional Information

Sometimes the descriptions provided by the government do not provide much detail on the type of work actually being performed under a grant.  Below are resources to find additional information:

* **CFDA**: Most grants have a linked Grant Program in the Overview section, which can provide additional detail on the program including the program's objective and eligibility.
* **FOIA Request**: A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request can be made to the awarding agency requesting additional details on the grant.
