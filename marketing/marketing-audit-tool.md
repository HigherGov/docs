The HigherGov marketing audit tool analyzes your organization's federal marketing presence in 30+ dimensions to help teaming partners and government procurement officers find you for solicitations, sole source awards, micro-purchases, and subawards.

To generate a marketing audit, go to the [Marketing Tools](https://www.highergov.com/marketing-tools/) available in the gear icon at the top of the page and select the Generate Audit button.  Once you select the button, we will begin an analysis of your federal marketing presence and email you within 7 days once the report is complete. &#x20;

We analyze marketing presence in the following 6 categories:

* SAM Registration
* DSBS Registration
* Other Registrations
* Certifications
* Website
* Small Business Portals

For each of the 35+ criteria we analyze, we will indicate whether your organization is meeting best practices (as indicated with a blue checkmark) or indicate if there are potential improvements that can be made (indicated by an orange lightbulb).
