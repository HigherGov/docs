# Customize Awardee Profile

More than 150K contractors and grant recipients, contracting officers, consultants, journalists, and investors use HigherGov every month to find partners, potential vendors, and to perform research. HigherGov offers several tools to help our subscribers promote their organizations on the platform.

## Customize Awardee Profile

{% hint style="info" %}
Profile customization is only available for companies that have active federal government registrations. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

Customizing your awardee profile allows you to provide a capability statement and provide a preferred contact and express your teaming goals.  Providing your capability statement also allows your profile to be included in our Capability Statement search in our [Partner Finder](https://www.highergov.com/partner-finder/) tool used by customers to find teaming partners.&#x20;

To customize your Awardee profile, open your [HigherGov Account](https://www.highergov.com/account/), complete the information under the Customize Awardee Profile section, and select Highlight Profile.  Once complete, select Update.
