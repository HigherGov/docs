Note that if you have more than one Pipeline selected the funnel will show the pipeline stages relative to Award (-1 meaning one stage from Award, -2 meaning two stages from Award) rather than by name.&#x20;

### Projections

Shows the weighted and unweighted value of the pipeline by Year, Quarter, or Month.
